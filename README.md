===========

AMS is the [Advanced Mac Substitute][AMS], a trap-level emulator for Mac OS.

This repository contains various 68K executables needed to run Mac apps using AMS.

Command-line programs
---------------------

  * `hello` is not needed by AMS, nor vice versa.  It's just a hand-coded 68K Hello World program, useful for testing that `xv68k` works.
